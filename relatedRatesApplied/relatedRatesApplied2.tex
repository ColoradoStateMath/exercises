        		A colony of bacterial are growing in a petri dish.  They form a circular disk, which appears to be growing at a rate of $4$ square millimeters per hour.  When the radius of the disk is $3$ millimeters, at what rate is the radius growing?

\begin{hint}
	Let $A$ be the area of the disk, and $r$ be its radius.  Then

\[
A = \pi r^2
\]
\end{hint}

\begin{hint}
	Differentiating implicitly with respect to time, we have
\[
\frac{\d A}{\d t} = 2\pi r \frac{\d r}{\d t}
\]
\end{hint}

\begin{hint}
	At the time in question, we know $r = 3$, and $\frac{\d A}{\d t} = 3$.  So 

\[
3 = 2 \pi (3) \frac{\d r}{\d t}
\]

so $\frac{\d r}{\d t} = \frac{1}{2\pi}$
\end{hint}

\begin{prompt}
	At this instant, the radius of this disk is growing at a rate of $\answer{\frac{1}{2\pi}}$ millimeters each second.
\end{prompt}
