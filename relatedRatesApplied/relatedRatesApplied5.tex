    Chronos is letting the sands of time slip through his fingers.  The sand accumulates in a conical pile whose radius is $4$ times its height.
        		
The  height of the cone is changing at a rate of $7$ miles per second at the instant that the cone is $8$ miles high.

What rate is the sand leaving his hands at this instant, in cubic miles per second?

\begin{prompt}
	The sand is leaving his hands at a rate of $ \answer{7168\pi}$ cubic miles each second.
\end{prompt}
