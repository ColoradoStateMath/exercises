In a feverish dream, you hatch a theory that to make the largest
chewing gum bubble imaginable, you need to blow it up so that the
radius is increasing at a constant rate of $5$ millimeters per second.
	 
When you awaken you decide to put your plan into action.  As a
function of the radius, at what rate must you pump air into the
(spherical) bubble?

\begin{prompt}
  When the radius of the bubble is $r$, we need $\dd[V]{t} = \answer{20\pi r^2}$
\end{prompt}
