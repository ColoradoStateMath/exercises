\outcome{Identify the relationships between the function and its first and second derivatives.}

%% BADBAD
%% Original question did not include 'twice differentiable'
%% I included this so to make the relation between the function
%% And it's first and second derivative clear
%% Also, I'm not aware if they know the definition
%% for concave and convex function in general

\tag{concavity}
\tag{derivative}

True or False?
\begin{quote}
It is possible for a twice differentiable function to be \textbf{increasing} and \textbf{concave down} on $(0,\infty)$ with a horizontal asymptote of $y=1$.

\begin{prompt}
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{True}
\choice{False}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{prompt}

\begin{hint}
Consider the graph of $f(x)=\frac{2}{\pi}\arctan(x)$. This should either provide a confirmation of your suspicion or a counter example. Notice that $\left|f(x)\right|\le1$, so $f(x)$ has a horizontal asymptote at $y=1$.
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
$f(x)$ is increasing. Recalling the derivative of the inverse tangent function, $f'(x)=\frac{1}{1+x^2}$, so $f'(x)>0$ for all $x$, in particular, for all $x$ in the interval $(0,\infty)$, so $f(x)$ is increasing on $(0,\infty)$.
\end{hint}

\begin{hint}
$f(x)$ is concave down. By the chain rule and the quotient rule, $f''(x)=-\frac{2x}{(1+x^2)^2}$ which is less than $0$ \emph{precisely} on $(0,\infty)$. So $f(x)$ is concave down.

Thus, $f$ is an example which demonstrates that it is possible for a function to be increasing (i.e., the first derivative is positive) and
