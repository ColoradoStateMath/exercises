Answer the following, given that it is a well known fact that  $\sum_{k=1}^{m}k=\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item		Find the right Riemann Sum for $n$ equally spaced rectangles approximating $\int_{-10}^{10}5-x\d x$ \[\int_{-10}^{10}5-x\d x\approx\answer{100-\frac{200}{n}}\]
\item		The limit as $n\to\infty$ of your answer to part (a) is: \[\answer{100}\]
\item		Does the answer to part (b) agree with the value of the integral $\int_{-10}^{10}5-x\d x$?
