\tag{related rates}

A circular balloon is inflated with air flowing at a rate of $10$cm$^3$/s. How fast is the radius of the balloon increasing when the radius is: \begin{enumerate}
\item		$1$cm? \[\answer{\frac{5}{2\pi}}\,cm/s\]
\item		$10$cm? \[\answer{\frac{1}{40\pi}}\,cm/s\]
\item		$100$cm? \[\answer{\frac{1}{4000\pi}}\,cm/s\]

\end{enumerate}

\begin{hint}
The volume of the balloon as a function of time is $V(t)=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ where $r$ is the radius of the balloon as a function of time. What is the derivative of $V(t)$ with respect to $t$. What about the derivative of $r^2$ with respect to $t$, given that $r$ is a function of time?
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
The derivative as a function of time is $10=4\pi r^2\frac{dr}{dt}$ since $\frac{dV}{dt}=10$cm$^3$/s.
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
Then $\frac{dr}{dt}=\frac{5}{2r^2\pi}$. For any value of $r$, we can find $\frac{dr}{dt}$ by plugging in that value.
