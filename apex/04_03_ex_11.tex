The United States Postal Service charges more for boxes whose combined length and girth exceeds $108$in (the `length' of a package is the length of its longest side; the girth is the perimeter of the cross section, i.e., $2w+2h$).

What is the maximum volume of a package with a square cross section, $w=h$, that does not exceed that $108$in standard?
\[
V_{max}=\answer{11664}\,in^3
\]
