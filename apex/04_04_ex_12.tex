Approximate $\sqrt[3]{63}$ using differentials.
\begin{enumerate}
\item		What is the most straightforward, reasonable choice of the function we should use to approximate $\sqrt[3]{63}$?\[f(x)=\answer{\sqrt[3]{x}}\]
\item		What is the most natural point $x$ to use if we wish to approximate $\sqrt[3]{63}$? (Hint: If we're lazy, then there is one point close to $63$ whose cubed root we know immediately.) \[x=\answer{64}\]
\item		Given your value for $x$, what value should $dx$ be if we wish to approximate $\sqrt[3]{63}$? \[dx=\answer{-1}\]
\item		Given your value for $dx$, what is $dy$? Express your answer as \textbf{fraction}. \[dy=\answer{-1/48}\]
\item		Finally, given your answers above, what is the approximation for $\sqrt[3]{63}$? Express your answer as a decimal, rounded to the nearest hundredth. \[\sqrt[3]{63}\approx\answer{3.98}\]
\end{enumerate}
