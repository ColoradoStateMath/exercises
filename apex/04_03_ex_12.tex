The strength $S$ of a wooden beam is directly proportional to its cross sectional  width $w$ and the square of its height $h$; that is, $S = kwh^2$ for some constant $k$. 

Given a circular log with a diameter of $12$in what are the dimensions of the beam that can be cut from the log with maximum strength?
\[
w=\answer{4\sqrt{3}}\,in
\]
\[
h=\answer{4\sqrt{6}}\,in
\]
