\tag{related rates}


An inverted cylindrical cone, $20$ft deep and $10$ft across at the top is being filled with water at a rate of $10$ft$^3$/min. (Recall: the volume of such a cone $V$ is given by $V=\frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h$ where $h$ is the height of the cone and $r$ is the radius of its base.)

What is the magnitude of the rate, $\tau$, that the water is rising at in the tank when the depth of the water is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item		$1$ft? Write DNE if the rate is undefined. \[\tau=\answer{\frac{160}{\pi}}\,ft/min\]
\item		$10$ft? Write DNE if the rate is undefined.
 \[\tau=\answer{\frac{8}{5\pi}}\,ft/min\]
\item		$10$ft? Write DNE if the rate is undefined. \[\tau=\answer{\frac{160}{361\pi}}\,ft/min\]
\end{enumerate}

At what time, $T$, will the tank be filled if it starts empty?
\[
T=\answer{\frac{500\pi}{30}}\,min
\]
