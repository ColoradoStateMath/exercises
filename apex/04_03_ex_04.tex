%% BADBAD 
%% Original question is find min sum of two numbers whose product is 500
%% but there is no global min to that function
%% For instance, 500/x describes the curve whose values satisfy x*500/x=500
%% But the set of sums {x+500/x:x in R} is not bounded below

Find the absolute minimum of a \textbf{positive} sum of two numbers whose product is $500$. Write DNE if no absolute minimum exists. \[\answer{20\sqrt{5}}\]
