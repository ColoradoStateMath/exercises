Find the absolute maximum of a sum of two numbers, each of which is in $[0,300]$ whose product is $500$.\[\answer{\frac{905}{3}}\]

\begin{hint}
If the two numbers are $x$ and $y$, then $xy=500$, so $y=\frac{500}{x}$, so we are left with the job of finding the absolute maximum of $x+\frac{500}{x}$ subject to the constraint that $x$ lie in $[0,300]$ (since $\frac{500}{x}\le300$ for all $x$ in $[0,300]$, we needn't worry that $y$ lies outside of $[0,300]$).
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
The only critical point of $x+\frac{500}{x}$ that lies in $[0,300]$ is a minimum. Since $[0,300]$ is a closed interval (i.e., it contains its endpoints), what can you say about where the maximum of $x+\frac{500}{x}$ must occur?
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
Recall that extrema can occur at critical points or at the endpoints of a closed interval, such as $[0,300]$. 
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
If $xy=500$, then $x$ cannot be $0$, so check the other endpoint.
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
If $x=300$, then $300+\frac{500}{300}=\frac{905}{3}$ must be the maximum. Indeed, it is the absolute maximum, for if $x<300$, then clearly $x+\frac{500}{x}<\frac{905}{3}$.
