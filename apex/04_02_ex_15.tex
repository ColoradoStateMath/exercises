\tag{related rates}


A company that produces landscaping materials is dumping sand into a conical pile. The sand is being poured at a rate of $5$ft$^3$/s; the physical properties of the sand, in conjunction with gravity, ensure that the cone's height is very nearly $2/3$ the length of the diameter of the circular base. 

How fast is the cone rising when it has a height of $30$ft?
\begin{center}
The cone is rising at a rate of $\answer{\frac{4}{45\pi}}\,ft/s$
\end{center}
