Find the absolute maximum product of two numbers (not necessarily integers) whose sum is $100$. Write DNE is no absolute maximum exists. 

\begin{hint}
We want to find the absolute maximum the product of two numbers (call them $x$ and $y$). Thus, we want to maximize $xy$ subject to the constraint that $x+y=100$.
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
Solving for $y$, we see that $y=100-x$. Then $xy=-x^2+100x$. We must find the absolute maximum of this product. 
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
If there is an absolute maximum, then, since $-x^2+100x$ is defined everywhere, the absolute maximum must occur where there is a local maximum. Hence, we find the critical points of $-x^2+100x$: $\frac{d}{dx}(-x^2+100x)=0$ and $\frac{d}{dx}(-x^2+100x)=100-2x$, hence, solving for $x$ in $100-2x=0$, we have $x=50$. So $x=50$ and $y=50$.

But is this a maximum or a minimum? By the second derivative test, $\frac{d^2}{dx^2}(-x^2+100x)=-2$ and $-2<0$, so this is a maximum. We see by inspection that it is an absolute maximum because the function does not attain a larger value.

Thus, $xy$ is maximized with $xy=2500$.
