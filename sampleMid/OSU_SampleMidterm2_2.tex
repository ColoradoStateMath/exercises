A boat sails directly toward a $200$ meter skyscraper that stands on the edge of a harbor. Let $\theta$ be the angle made with respect to the horizontal of a line extending from the boat to the top of the skyscraper.
\begin{enumerate}
\item		Express the angle $\theta$ as a function of $x$, the distance of the boat from the building. \[\theta(x)\begin{prompt} = \answer{\arctan(200/x)}\end{prompt}\]
\item		The boat is sailing directly toward the skyscraper at $3$ meters per second. Find $\frac{d\theta}{dt}$ when the boat is $x=500$ meters from the building. \[\frac{d\theta}{dt}\begin{prompt} = \answer{\frac{3}{1450}}\end{prompt}\]
\end{enumerate}
