A circle is expanding.  At time $t_0$, its radius is $2 \textrm{m}$, and is growing at a rate of $4 \frac{\textrm{m}}{\textrm{s}}$.  At what rate is its area growing at the time $t_0$?

\begin{hint}
	Let $A$ be the area, and $r$ be the radius.  Then

	\[A = \pi r^2\]
\end{hint}

\begin{hint}
	Differentiating with respect to time, we have

	\[\frac{\d A}{\d t} = 2\pi r \frac{\d r}{\d t}\]
\end{hint}

\begin{hint}
	So at time $t_0$,

	\[ \left.\frac{\d A}{\d t}\right|_{t = t_0} = 2 \pi (2) (4) = 16 \pi \]
\end{hint}

\begin{prompt}
	\[\left.\frac{\d A}{\d t}\right|_{t = t_0} = \answer{16\pi}\]
\end{prompt}
