\tag{integral}

A vase has a shape which can be described as a solid of revolution.  It is obtained by revolving the region bounded by $y=x^3$, the $y$ axis, $y=0$, and $y=9$.  All units are measured in inches.

Water is filling the vase at a rate of $2 \frac{\unit{in}^3}{\unit{s}}$.

At what rate is the height of the water increasing at the time when it is $8$ inches high?

\begin{hint}
	At a given height $y$, we have that $x  = y^{\frac{1}{3}}$.  Thus the disk with height $\d y$ at height $x$ has volume $\d V = \pi y^{\frac{2}{3}} \d y$
\end{hint}

\begin{hint}
	Thus we have $\frac{\d V}{\d t} = \pi y^{\frac{2}{3}} \frac{\d y}{\d t}$
\end{hint}

\begin{hint}
	So at $y=8$, we have
	
	\[
	2 = \pi 8^\frac{2}{3} \frac{\d y}{\d t}
	\]
	
	which implies
	
	\[
	\frac{\d y}{\d t} = \frac{1}{2\pi}
	\]
\end{hint}

\begin{prompt}
	\[
	\frac{\d y}{\d t} = \answer{\frac{1}{2\pi}} \unit{m}/\unit{s}
	\]
\end{prompt}
