\outcome{Understand the definition of the derivative at a point.}
\outcome{Compute the derivative of a function at a point.}
\outcome{Write the equation of the tangent line to a graph at a given point.}

\tag{limit}

Consider 
\[
f(x) = \frac{x}{2}+\frac{2}{x}
\]



\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the equation of the secant line connecting the point $(2,f(2))$ to the point $(2,f(2.1))$? 
\begin{prompt} 
The equation of this secant line is
$$ y = \answer{0.0238095x+1.95238 }$$ 
\end{prompt}

\item  Use the definition of the derivative to find the slope of the tangent line to $f$ at $x=2$, and use this to find the equation of this tangent line.

\begin{prompt} 
The equation of this tangent line is
$$ y = \answer{2}$$ 
\end{prompt}

\end{enumerate}

Isn't it cool how the coefficients in the equation of the secant line are close to those of the tangent line?
