\tag{related rates}

A road running in a northwest direction crosses a road going east to
west at a $120^\circ$ at a point $P$. Car $A$ is driving northwesterly
along the first road, and car $B$ is driving east along the second
road. At a particular time car $A$ is $10$ kilometers to the northwest
of P and traveling at $80$ km/hr, while car $B$ is $15$ kilometers to
the east of $P$ and traveling at $100$ km/hr. How fast is the distance
between the two cars changing? Hint, recall the law of cosines:
$c^2=a^2+b^2-2ab\cos\theta$.
\begin{prompt}
  \[
  \answer{136\sqrt{475}/19}\,\text{km/hr}
