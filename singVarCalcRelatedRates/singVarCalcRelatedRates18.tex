\tag{related rates}

Suppose a car is driving north along a road at $80$ km/hr and an
airplane is flying east at speed $200$ km/hr. Their paths crossed at a
point $P$. At a certain time, the car is 10 kilometers north of $P$
and the airplane is 15 kilometers to the east of $P$ at an altitude of
2 km. How fast is the distance between car and airplane changing?
\begin{prompt}
  \[
  \answer{3800/\sqrt{329}}\,\text{km/hr}
  \]
\end{prompt}
