A road running north to south crosses a road going east to west at the
point $P$. Car A is 300 meters north of $P$, car B is 400 meters east
of $P$, both cars are going at constant speed toward $P$, and the two
cars will collide in 10 seconds. How fast is the distance between the
two cars changing?
