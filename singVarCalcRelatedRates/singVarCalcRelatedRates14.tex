A police helicopter is flying at 200 kilometers per hour at
a constant altitude of 1 km above a straight road.  The pilot uses
radar to determine that an oncoming car is at a distance of exactly 2
kilometers from the helicopter, and that this distance is decreasing at 250
kph.  Find the speed of the car.
