\tag{related rates}

A pyramid-shaped vat has square cross-section and stands on its
tip.  The dimensions at the top are 2 m $\times$ 2 m, and the depth is
5 m.  If water is flowing into the vat at 3 m${}^3$/min, how fast is
the water level rising when the depth of water (at the deepest point)
is 4 m?  Note: the volume of any ``conical'' shape (including
pyramids) is $(1/3)(\hbox{height})(\hbox{area of base})$.
