A police helicopter is flying at 150 mph at a constant altitude of 0.5 mile
above a straight road.  The pilot uses radar to determine that an oncoming
car is at a distance of exactly 1 mile from the helicopter, and that this
distance is decreasing at 190 mph.  Find the speed of the car.
\begin{prompt}
  \[
  \answer{380/\sqrt{3}-150}\,\text{mph}
  \]
\end{prompt}
