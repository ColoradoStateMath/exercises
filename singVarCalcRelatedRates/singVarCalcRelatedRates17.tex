\tag{related rates}

A road running north to south crosses a road going east to west at the
point $P$. Eight seconds ago car $A$ started from rest at $P$ and has
been driving north, picking up speed at the steady rate of $5$
m/sec${}^2$. Six seconds after car $A$ started, car $B$ passed $P$
moving east at constant speed 60 m/sec. How fast is the distance
between the two cars changing?
