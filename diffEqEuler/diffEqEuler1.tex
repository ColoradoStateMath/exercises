Let $f$ be a function with $f(2) = 4$, and $f$ is a solution to the differential equation 

\[

\frac{\d y}{\d x} = y-x

\]

Follow the following set of steps (Called ``Euler's method'') to approximate $f(2.3)$:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Find an approximate value of $f(2.1)$ by using the linear approximation at $(2,4)$.  Call this approximation $y_1$, so $(2.1,y_1)$ is close to being on the graph of $f$.
	\item Use the linear approximation at $(2.1,y_1)$ to approximate the value of $f(2.2)$.  Call this $y_2$, so that $(2.2,y_2)$ is appoximately on the curve.
	\item Finally, use the linear approximation at $(2.2,y_2)$ to approximate the value of $f(2.3)$, which we call $y_3$.
	\end{itemize}

This is an example of a ``numerical method'' for approximating a solution to a differential equation.
