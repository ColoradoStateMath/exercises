Let $f$ be a function with $f(1) = 1$, and $f$ is a solution to the differential equation 

\[

\frac{\d y}{\d x} = xy

\]

Follow the following set of steps (Called ``Euler's method'') to approximate $f(1.2)$:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Find an approximate value of $f(1.1)$ by using the linear approximation at $(1,1)$.  Call this approximation $y_1$, so $(1.1,y_1)$ is close to being on the graph of $f$.
	\item Use the linear approximation at $(1.1,y_1)$ to approximate the value of $f(1.2)$.  Call this $y_2$, so that $(1.2,y_2)$ is appoximately on the curve.
	\end{itemize}

This is an example of a ``numerical method'' for approximating a solution to a differential equation.
