Let $Q(x) = \frac{A(x)}{B(x)}$

If you know that $A(9) = 0$, $A'(9) = 0$, $B(9) > 0$, and $B'(9) > 0$, what can you say about the sign of $P'(9)$?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{$Q'(9)>0$}
\choice{$Q'(9)<0$}
\choice[correct]{$Q'(9) = 0$}
\choice{We cannot determine the sign of $Q'(9)$}
\end{multipleChoice}

Try to make sense of this by thinking about small increases/decreases in the quantities $A$ and $B$, in addition to symbolic calculation.
