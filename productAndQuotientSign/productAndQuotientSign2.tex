Let $P(x) = A(x)B(x)$

If you know that $A(3) < 0$, $A'(3) > 0$, $B(3) > 0$, and $B'(3) < 0$, what can you say about the sign of $P'(3)$?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{$P'(3)>0$}
\choice{$P'(3)<0$}
\choice{$P'(3) = 0$}
\choice{We cannot determine the sign of $P'(3)$}
\end{multipleChoice}

Try to make sense of this by thinking about small increases/decreases in the quantities $A$ and $B$, in addition to symbolic calculation.
