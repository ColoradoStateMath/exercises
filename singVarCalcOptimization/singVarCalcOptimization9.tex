  You want to make cylindrical containers to hold 1 liter using the
  least amount of construction material.  The side is made from a
  rectangular piece of material, and this can be done with no material
  wasted.  However, the top and bottom are cut from squares of side
  $2r$, so that $2(2r)^2=8r^2$ of material is needed (rather than
  $2\pi r^2$, which is the total area of the top and bottom).  Find
  the dimensions of the container using the least amount of material,
  and also find the ratio of height to radius for this container.
  \begin{prompt}
  \[
  \text{radius}=\answer{5}\qquad\text{height}=\answer{40/\pi}
  \]
  \end{prompt}
