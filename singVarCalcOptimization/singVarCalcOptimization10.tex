  The strength of a rectangular beam is proportional to the product of
  its width $w$ times the square of its depth $d$.  Find the
  dimensions of the strongest beam that can be cut from a cylindrical
  log of radius $r$.

  \begin{prompt}
  \[
  \text{width}=\answer{2r/\sqrt{3}}\qquad\text{height}=\answer{2\sqrt2r/\sqrt{3}}
  \]
