  Marketing tells you that if you set the price of an item at \$10
  then you will be unable to sell it, but that you can sell 500 items
  for each dollar below \$10 that you set the price.  Suppose your
  fixed costs total \$3000, and your marginal cost is \$2 per item.
  What is the most profit you can make?
