  A window is to be built in the shape of a semi-circle over a rectangle:
  \begin{image}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw[very thick,penColor] (2,0) arc (0:180:2 and 2);% top half of ellipse
      \draw[penColor, very thick] (-2,-2) -- (2,-2);
      \draw[penColor, very thick] (2,-2) -- (2,0);
      \draw[penColor,very thick] (-2,-2) -- (-2,0);
      \draw[penColor,very thick,dashed] (-2,0) -- (2,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{image}
  If the area of the window is $\pi/2$ square meters, minimize the
  outer perimeter.
