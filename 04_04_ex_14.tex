Approximate $\sin(3)$ using differentials.
\begin{enumerate}
\item		What is the most straightforward, reasonable choice of the function we should use to approximate $\sin(3)$?\[f(x)=\answer{\sin(x)}\]
\item		What is the most natural point $x$ to use if we wish to approximate $\sin(3)$? (Hint: If we're lazy, then there is one point close to $3$ whose sine we know immediately.) \[x=\answer{\pi}\]
\item		Given your value for $x$, what value should $dx$ be if we wish to approximate $\sin(3)$? (Hint: You should subtract your answer above from something.) \[dx=\answer{3-\pi}\]
\item		Given your value for $dx$, what is $dy$? \[dy=\answer{\pi-3}\]
\item		Finally, given your answers above, what is the approximation for $\sin(3)$? Express your answer as a decimal, rounded to the nearest hundredth. \[\sin(3)\approx\answer{0.14}\]
\end{enumerate}
