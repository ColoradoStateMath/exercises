% The r@{.}l aligns everything at a common decimal point by constructing two columns and 
% aligning them together at that decimal point to create the effect that only a single column is
% there. It's a quick fix to a very minor blemish in the source.

% We need the multicolumn{2}{c} to align the 'h' over the center of the two columns we have     
% made, since we cannot just change the number of columns midway through our construction. 
% By indicating that there are 2 columns we are merging, TeX understands our construction.

% I have to  put extra columns into this one, else the RHS doesn't line up quite right. Better way to 
% do this?



Let $f({x}) = x^2+3x-7$ and $a=1$. Observe the table of values for $\frac{f({a+h})-f({a})}{h}$:
\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{r@{.}lc@{\hspace{30pt}}r@{.}l}
  \multicolumn{2}{c}{$h$} & \multicolumn{3}{c}{$\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}$}\\ \hline 
  $-0$ & $1$ & & $4$ & $9$  \\
  $-0$ & $01$ & & $4$ & $99$ \\
  $0$ & $01$ & & $5$ & $01$ \\
  $0$ & $1$ & & $5$ & $1$
 \end{tabular}
\end{center}
The limit as $h\to 0$ is approximately $\begin{prompt}\answer{5}\end{prompt}$.
