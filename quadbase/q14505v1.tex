\begin{exercise}

Algae cover in a pond is growing day by day. If the area covered is
circular, and $t=0$ is the point when algae started growing, then the
change in area is $\frac{dA}{dt} = e^{.02t}$ m$^2$ per day. What is the
rate of change of the radius when the algae has been growing for 30 days
and the radius is 5.385 m? Please give a decimal solution to three
significant digits and, as always, include units.

``Hint: significant digits are the ones that you write down in
scientific notation.''


\begin{hint}
This is a related rates problem. You need to identify the variables and
their relation, take the derivative with respect to time of the
relation, and solve for the desired rate.
\end{hint}


\begin{hint}
Variables:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  $t$ time in days since the algal outbreak
\item
  $r$ radius of the algal cover in meters, function of time
\item
  $A$ area of the algal cover in square meters, function of time
\end{itemize}

Relation

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  $A = \pi r^2$
\end{itemize}

Known values

\begin{itemize}
\item
  $\frac{dA}{dt} = e^{.02t}$ m$^2$/day
\item
  $A(0) = r(0) = 0$
\item
  $t_i = 30$ days at time of interest
\item
  $r=5.385$ m at time of interest
\end{itemize}

Differentiating the relation we have:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  $\frac{dA}{dt} = 2\pi r \frac{dr}{dt}$
\end{itemize}

Plugging in our values, we have: \begin{align*}
\frac{dA}{dt} &= 2\pi r \frac{dr}{dt} \\
e^{.02(30)} &= 2\pi (5.385) \frac{dr}{dt} \\
\frac{dr}{dt} &= .0539 m/day
\end{align*}
\end{hint}
