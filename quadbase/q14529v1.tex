\begin{exercise}

Find and identify the extrema of $q(r) = 3r-5$ on the domain
$1 \leq r \leq 5$.


\begin{hint}
This is a bounded extrema problem. First, check for critical points of
the function and then check the end points to determine whether they are
maxima or minima.
\end{hint}


\begin{hint}
Since $q= 3r-5$ is a linear function, the derivative $q' = 3$ is a
non-zero constant and thus has no critical points. Therefore, any
extrema are located at the ends of the domain. Since the slope $q'$ is
positive, that means that the left endpoint will be a minimum and the
right endpoint will be a maximum.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  $r=1$ is a minimum
\item
  $r=5$ is a maximum
\end{itemize}
\end{hint}


\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{There is one extremum: a maximum at $r=5$.}
\choice{There are no extrema for the function $q$.}
\choice{There is one extremum: a minimum at $r=1$.}
\choice[correct]{There are two extrema: one minimum at $r=1$ and one maximum at $r=5$.}
\choice{There is one extremum: a minimum at $r=5$.}
\end{multipleChoice}
