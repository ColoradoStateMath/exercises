\begin{exercise}

Use a spreadsheet to estimate
\[\lim_{t\to .3} \frac{e^{t^2}}{(t-.3)^2}.\] Find the smallest number of
the form $t=.3 + 10^{-k}$ for $k=2, 3, 4, \ldots$ (that is $t=.301$,
$t=.3001$, etc) that will give you at least 7 digits of accuracy in the
limit.


\begin{hint}
Plug in pairs of points .31 and .29, .301 and .299 approaching .3 from
above and below. When the digits stabilize in their numerical
approximation, you are approaching the correct limit. For a general
function, you should be careful to check the graph as well to determine
that a limit actually exists.
\end{hint}


\begin{hint}
One possible spreadsheet is shown below:
\{img:numerical-limit-approx\_1.jpg\}

As you can see, coming toward .3 from the positive side always gives an
underestimate of the value while coming from the negative side gives an
overestimate. We finally have more than two decimal places of agreement
when we get to the $f(0.30000000001) = -20.59987566$ and
$f(0.29999999999) = -20.59987566$ pair.
\end{hint}


\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{0.30000001}
\choice{0.300000000001}
\choice{0.300001}
\choice{0.3000000001}
\end{multipleChoice}
