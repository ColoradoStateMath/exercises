Find, and identify, the extreme values of $g(t) = -|t|$.


\begin{hint}
This is an extreme value problem. Solve it by identifying the critical
point(s) of the function and using the first derivative test to
determine whether they are maxima or minima.
\end{hint}


\begin{hint}
First, recall that \[g'(t) = \begin{cases} 1 & t < 0 \\ -1 & t > 0 \\
\mbox{DNE} & t=0 \end{cases}.\] Therefore, there is a critical point of
$g$ at $t^*=0$, where the derivative does not exist. Since for
$t < t^*$, $g'(t) > 0$ and for $t > t^*$, $g'(t) < 0$, we see by the
first derivative test that $t^*$ is a (global) maximum for $g$.
\end{hint}


\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{There is a critical point of $g$ at $t=0$, and $t=0$ is a (global)
minimum for $g$.}
\choice[correct]{There is a critical point of $g$ at $t=0$, and $t=0$ is a (global)
maximum for $g$.}
\choice{There is a critical point of $g$ at $t=0$, but there are no extrema.}
\choice{There are no critical points of $g$, so there are no extrema.}
\end{multipleChoice}
