\begin{exercise}

Head loss is the loss of energy through friction and turbulence in a
real liquid flowing through a pipe. The Darcy-Weisbach equation gives a
measure of head loss due to friction, $h_f$, for a liquid filling a pipe
with circular cross-section: \[h_f = \frac{8f_D LQ^2}{g\pi^2D^5}, \]
where $f_D$ is the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor, $L$ is the length of
the pipe, $Q$ is the volumetric flow rate, $g$ is the gravitational
constant, and $D$ is the diameter of the pipe.

If $L=50$ m, $Q = 4-4\cos(t)$ m/s, $g=9.8$ m/s$^2$, $D=.5$ m, and
$f_D = .035$, calculate $\frac{dh_f}{dt}$ at $t=3\pi$ minutes if $L$,
$D$, and $f_D$ are constant. Give your answer to three significant
digits. Note, the units of $h_f$ are meters.


\begin{hint}
This is a related rates problem with a given relationship. You need to
take the derivative of the given equation and then plug in the
appropriate values.
\end{hint}


\begin{hint}
Taking the derivative of the equation, and accounting for the constants
$L$, $D$, $f_D$, $\pi$ and $g$, we have
\[\frac{dh_f}{dt} = \frac{8f_DL(2Q)}{g\pi^2D^5}\left(\frac{dQ}{dt}\right).\]

Plugging in our values, we have: \begin{align*}\frac{dh_f}{dt} &= \frac{8(.035)(50)(8-8\cos(3\pi*60))}{(9.8)\pi^2(.5^5)}\left(4\sin(3\pi*60)\right)\\
&= 0
\end{align*}
