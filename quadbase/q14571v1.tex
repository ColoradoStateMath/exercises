\begin{exercise}

When using Newton's method to estimate the $\sqrt{10}$, if the initial
guess is $1$, how many iterations are required to get an estimate which
is correct to at least 8 decimal places?


\begin{hint}
This requires iterating Newton's Method beginning with an initial guess
of $x_0=1$ for the function $f(x) = x^2-10$ and checking the error from
$\sqrt{10}$ at each step.
\end{hint}


\begin{hint}
Using a spreadsheet to calculate these iterations, we have:

 Therefore, at step 5 we have a value
which differs from $\sqrt{10}$ by only
$-0.000000005 = -5\times 10^{-9}$, so our answer is correct to 8 decimal
places. Earlier steps differed by significantly more. At step 4, for
instance, our answer was only correct to 3 decimal places.
\end{hint}
