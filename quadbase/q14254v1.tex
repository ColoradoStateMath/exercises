Head loss is the loss of energy through friction and turbulence in a
real liquid flowing through a pipe. The Darcy-Weisbach equation gives a
measure of head loss due to friction, $h_f$, for a liquid filling a pipe
with circular cross-section: \[h_f = \frac{8f_DLQ^2}{g\pi^2D^5}, \]
where $f_D$ is the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor, $L$ is the length of
the pipe, $Q$ is the volumetric flow rate, $g$ is the gravitational
constant, and $D$ is the diameter of the pipe.

Assuming that $f_D$, $L$, and $D$ are constant, calculate
\[\frac{dh_f}{dQ}.\]


\begin{hint}
This is a power rule derivative, all of the complicated factors are
simply named constants.
\end{hint}


\begin{hint}
Using the linearity rule with respect to constants, this derivative
becomes
\begin{align*} \frac{dh_f}{dQ} &= \frac{d}{dQ}\left(\frac{8f_DLQ^2}{g\pi^2D^5}\right) \\
&= \left(\frac{8f_DL}{g\pi^2D^5}\right) \frac{d}{dQ}\left(Q^2\right) \\
&= \left(\frac{8f_DL}{g\pi^2D^5}\right)(2Q) \\
&= \boxed{\frac{16f_DLQ}{g\pi^2D^5}}
\end{align*}
\end{hint}
