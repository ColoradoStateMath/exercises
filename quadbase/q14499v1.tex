\begin{exercise}

Consider the intersection of two country roads shown below. If a cow is
ambling away from the intersection at a leisurely 3 miles per hour and a
cowherd is running toward the intersection at a blazing 10 miles per
hour, what is the speed at which the cowherd is approaching the cow when
he is 2 miles away from the intersection and the cow passed the
intersection 40 minutes earlier?

\begin{hint}
This is a related rates problem. You need to begin by identifying your
variables, finding a relation, differentiating the relation and plugging
in known (and/or computed) values to find the desired rate.
\end{hint}

Variables

\begin{itemize}
\item
  $a$ is the distance from the cowherd to the intersection in miles
\item
  $b$ is the distance from the cow to the intersection in miles
\item
  $c$ is the distance from the cow to the cowherd in miles
\end{itemize}

Relation

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  $a^2+b^2 = c^2$
\end{itemize}

Known values

\begin{itemize}
\item
  $a = 2$ miles
\item
  $b = 3$ miles/hour $*2/3$ hours = 2 miles
\item
  $c = \sqrt{2^2+2^2} = \sqrt{8}$ miles
\item
  $\frac{da}{dt} = -10$ miles per hour
\item
  $\frac{db}{dt} = 3$ miles per hour
\end{itemize}

Want to know?

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  $\frac{dc}{dt}$
\end{itemize}

Differentiate

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  $2a\frac{da}{dt} + 2b\frac{db}{dt} = 2c\frac{dc}{dt}$
\end{itemize}

Plugging in: \begin{align*}
2(2)\left(-10\right) + 2(2)\left(3\right) &= 2(\sqrt{8})\frac{dc}{dt} \\
\frac{dc}{dt} &= \frac{-40+12}{2\sqrt{8}} \\
&= -\frac{14}{\sqrt{8}} \\
&= -\frac{7}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{align*} So the cowherd is closing on the cow at a rate of
$\frac{7}{\sqrt{2}} \simeq 4.95$ miles per hour.
