\begin{exercise}

Sketch a tangent line to the curve at point C and identify whether the
derivative of the curve at point C is positive, negative, zero, or
undefined.

\begin{hint}
Because the slope of the tangent line is negative at the point C, the
derivative will also be negative at that point.
\end{hint}


\begin{hint}
\begin{image}\includegraphics{slopegraphtangentC.jpg}\end{image}

 As you can see, the slope of the tangent
line to the curve $f(t)$ through point $C$ is negative--it increases in
value as you move left, in the negative direction. Therefore, the point
$C$ has a negative value of the derivative.
\end{hint}
