\begin{exercise}

Sketch a tangent line to the curve at point B and identify whether the
derivative of the curve at point B is positive, negative, zero, or
undefined.

\begin{hint}
The slope of the tangent line through a point gives the value of the
derivative at that point for every continuous function.
\end{hint}


\begin{hint}
\begin{image}\includegraphics{slopegraphtangentB.jpg}\end{image}

 As you can see, the tangent curve through
B appears to be horizontal--that is that it has zero slope, so it is
reasonable to claim that B is a point on the curve where the derivative
is zero.
\end{hint}
