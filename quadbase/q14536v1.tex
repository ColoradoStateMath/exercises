\begin{exercise}

Is there a solution of the equation $f(x) = x^5-4x^3+2x-3 = 0$ between
$x=0$ and $x=2$? Why or why not?


\begin{hint}
The mean value theorem does not give us anything useful here, but the
intermediate value theorem does.
\end{hint}


\begin{hint}
Yes, the Intermediate Value Theorem says that since
$f(0) = 0^5-4(0^4)+2(0)-3 = -3 < 0$ and
$f(2) = 2^5-4(2^3)+2(2)-3 = 1 > 0$ there must be a point $c \in (0,2)$
with $f(c) = c^5-4c^3+2c-3 = 0$.

The mean value theorem tells us about the derivative of a function,
while the intermediate value theorem tells us about the function itself.
\end{hint}


\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{Yes, the Intermediate Value Theorem says that since
$f(0) = 0^5-4(0^4)+2(0)-3 = -3 < 0$ and
$f(2) = 2^5-4(2^3)+2(2)-3 = 1 > 0$ there must be a point $c \in (0,2)$
with $f(c) = c^5-4c^3+2c-3 = 0$.}
\choice{We cannot determine whether $f$ ever reaches 0 in the interval $(0,2)$.
The Mean Value Theorem says that since
\[\frac{f(2)-f(0)}{2-0} = \frac{-3-1}{2} = -2,\] there is a point
$c \in (0,2)$ where $f'(x) = -2$, but since this is only one point it
doesn't give us sufficient information to determine.}
\choice{No, the Mean Value Theorem says that since
\[\frac{f(2)-f(0)}{2-0} = \frac{-3-1}{2} = -2,\] there is a point
$c \in (0,2)$ where $f'(x) = -2$ so the negative slope and negative
starting value mean we never reach 0.}
