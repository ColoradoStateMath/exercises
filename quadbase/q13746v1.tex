Calculate \[\lim_{x\to -2} \frac{x+4}{x^2+4x+4}.\]


\begin{hint}
The denominator is non-negative, but zero at the point in question,
$x=-2$. Therefore, the sign of the non-zero numerator evaluated at the
point in question will indicate the proper infinity.
\end{hint}


\begin{hint}
We wish to calculate \[\lim_{x\to -2} \frac{x+4}{x^2+4x+4}.\] Plugging
in the value $x=-2$ we get
\[\frac{-2+4}{(-2)^2+4(-2)+4} = \frac{2}{0},\] which is undefined.
However, in the limit as $x$ approaches $-2$, the denominator
\[x^2+4x+4 = (x+2)^2\] is always positive, except at the vertex of the
parabola when $x=-2$. Thus, as $x \to -2$ the denominator is positive
and very very close to zero. The numerator, by contrast, is continuous
and non-zero so as $x\to -2$ it takes values very very close to
$-2+4=2$. If we take numbers close to $2$ and divide them by smaller and
smaller positive numbers we end up with larger and larger positive
numbers--we express by saying that the limit is positive infinity:
\[\lim_{x\to -2} \frac{x+4}{x^2+4x+4} = \infty.\]
\end{hint}
