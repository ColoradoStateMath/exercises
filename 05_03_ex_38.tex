\tag{Riemann sum}
\tag{integral}

Answer the following, given that it is a well known fact that  $\sum_{k=1}^{m}k^2=\frac{m(m+1)(2m+1)}{6}$ and $\sum_{k=1}^{m}k^3=\frac{m^2(m+1)^2}{4}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item		Find the right Riemann Sum for $n$ equally spaced rectangles approximating $\int_{0}^{1}x^3-x^2\d x$ \[\int_{0}^{1}x^3-x^2\d x\approx\answer{\frac{1}{12}(\frac{1}{n^2}-1)}\]
\item		The limit as $n\to\infty$ of your answer to part (a) is: \[\answer{-\frac{1}{12}}\]
\item		Does the answer to part (b) agree with the value of the integral $\int_{0}^{1}x^3-x^2\d x$?
